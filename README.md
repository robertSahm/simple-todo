# Robby's Notes on the Test


First off, thanks so much for taking the time to look at this! Of all the application code tests I've taken, I think I like this one the best. It's simple yet open-ended and allows the applicant to show their personal strengths and a little flair.

## My Implimentations
- ### Component Library - Material UI 
  - I've set up a pretty basic use-case with mostly default or simple styling with a bit of responsiveness. I didn't get too complicated on the CSS in JS side of things, as I felt it would have been a bit much to set up for the scope of the app and time contstraints.
- ### Style Checking (Prettier)
  - I set up Prettier to run some basic scripts (`fix-code` and `fix-styles`) to clean up the JS and CSS files. In VS Code I often use the "Format Document" and "Format Selection" options.
